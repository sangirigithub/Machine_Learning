# My Machine Learning & Python Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating my Machine Learning & Python programming skills.
Having participated in various Hackathons and Woman in Data Science Workshops/Hackathons made me feel confident to solve complex real-world problems.

## Notebooks:
- **kaggle-Jan'24_CancerDiagnosis_CatBoost_Corr_WiDS**: EDA & ML Classification Model
- **kaggle-Feb'23_WeatherForecast_RFModel_Corr_PValue_PCA_WiDS**: EDA & ML Regression Model
- **hackathon-Oct'23_Name_Address_Matching_soundex-searchAlgorithm**: NLP Techniques
- **kaggle-Aug'20_SalesForecast_LassoLinearRegression_IIIT-H**: ML Regression Model

Feel free to explore the notebooks and provide feedback!
